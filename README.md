# BACnet Masquerade Router  The BACnet Masquerade Router (BMR) application is a BACnet router between one or more BACnet/IPv4 networks and Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN) of virtual BACnet devices (VDB).  The virtual devices masquerade as a "digital twin" of real devices, masking some objects and properties and making others available.
